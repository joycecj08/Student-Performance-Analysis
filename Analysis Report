1. Data Collection
- Loaded the Student Performance Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled numerical features.
 3. Feature Selection
- Selected features highly correlated with the target variable (final grade).
4. Model Building
- Built a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated the model with Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score.
5. Model Tuning
- Tuned the Linear Regression model using GridSearchCV.
- Improved model performance.
